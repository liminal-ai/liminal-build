# Test Plan: Epic 7 Archive and Derived Views

## Purpose

This test plan maps every Epic 7 test condition to planned tests. It verifies
canonical archive append/read behavior, finalization boundaries, turn
derivation, structural derived views, provenance enrichment, and degraded reads.

Related design: `docs/spec-build/v2/epics/07--archive-and-derived-views/tech-design.md`

## Test Strategy

### Test Layers

| Layer | Files | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Convex service tests | `convex/archiveEntries.test.ts`, `convex/archiveTurns.test.ts`, `convex/derivedArchiveViews.test.ts` | Durable append/read, sequence, idempotency, cached projections |
| Fastify service/API tests | `tests/service/server/archive-api.test.ts`, `tests/service/server/archive-finalization.test.ts`, `tests/service/server/turn-derivation.test.ts`, `tests/service/server/derived-archive-view.test.ts` | Auth/access, finalization policy, archive reads, derivation, degraded states |
| Client service tests | `tests/service/client/archive-section.test.ts`, `tests/service/client/archive-turns-section.test.ts`, `tests/service/client/derived-archive-views.test.ts` | User-visible archive, turn, structural-view, empty, pagination, and degraded states |
| Existing live/process tests | `tests/service/client/process-live.test.ts`, `tests/service/server/process-live-updates.test.ts`, `tests/service/server/process-execution-orchestrator.test.ts` | Ensure live upserts remain separate from archive finalization |

### Mock Boundaries

| Boundary | Mock? | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Artifact/source enrichment services | Yes in archive read tests | Mock unavailable related context to verify per-entry degradation |
| Environment/provider runtime | Yes | Finalization tests use completed/interrupted fake runtime objects |
| Convex in route tests | Existing fake/in-memory PlatformStore pattern | Route tests exercise Fastify services without live Convex |
| Internal derivation helpers | No | Test via `TurnDerivationService` and `DerivedArchiveViewService` |
| Client API calls | Yes | Client tests mock fetch/API layer only |

## Non-TC Decided Tests

| Test File | Test Description | Reason |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| `tests/service/client/archive-section.test.ts` | archive contract schemas accept all Epic 7 entry kinds and reject non-finalized entries | Protects shared contract vocabulary before route work |
| `tests/service/client/process-live.test.ts` | live history upserts still update current process history without creating archive rows | Protects live/archive separation |
| `tests/service/server/archive-finalization.test.ts` | `appendFromProcessHistoryItem` maps `process_message` to `model_message` only for finalized compatible items | Compatibility bridge clarity |
| `tests/service/server/turn-derivation.test.ts` | pre-user-message entries form deterministic turn zero | Edge case in grouping rules |
| `tests/service/server/turn-derivation.test.ts` | turn-cache rebuild preserves stable turn provenance for derived views | Prevents dangling view references after rebuild |
| `tests/service/server/derived-archive-view.test.ts` | `chunk_candidate` rejects generated summary body content | Prevents summarization scope creep |
| `tests/service/server/derived-archive-view.test.ts` | stale derived views are rebuilt from current turns without breaking archive reads | Covers rebuild consistency after new archive entries |
| `convex/archiveEntries.test.ts` | sequence assignment is atomic across same-process appends | Protects ordering under concurrent writes |
| `tests/service/server/archive-api.test.ts` | derived-view refresh conflict returns `ARCHIVE_DERIVATION_CONFLICT` | Error contract coverage |
| `tests/service/server/archive-api.test.ts` | invalid archive query returns `INVALID_ARCHIVE_REQUEST` | Error contract coverage |

## Chunk Test Counts

| Chunk | TC Tests | Non-TC Tests | Total | Primary Files |
|-------|----------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| 0 Foundation | 0 | 1 | 1 | contract/schema/fixture tests |
| 1 Archive persistence | 9 | 1 | 10 | Convex archive entries, archive API |
| 2 Finalization boundary | 5 | 2 | 7 | archive finalization, live tests |
| 3 Archive read/reopen | 7 | 1 | 8 | archive API, client archive section |
| 4 Turn derivation | 5 | 2 | 7 | turn derivation service |
| 5 Structural views | 7 | 3 | 10 | derived-view service/client |
| 6 Provenance coherence | 4 | 0 | 4 | archive API enrichment |
| 7 Reopen/bounded degradation | 4 | 0 | 4 | archive API, derived-view service |
| **Total** | **41** | **10** | **51** |  |

Epic 7 has 41 named TCs. Non-TC tests cover live/archive separation,
compatibility mapping, turn-zero grouping, turn-cache rebuild stability,
no-summary enforcement, stale/rebuilt derived views, atomic sequence
assignment, invalid archive requests, and refresh conflict behavior.

## Verification Gates

| Phase | Command | Expected Result |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Skeleton / Red exit | `pnpm run red-verify` | Format, lint, typecheck, and build pass while new behavior tests fail against stubs |
| Development | `pnpm run verify` | Standard project verification passes |
| Green exit | `pnpm run green-verify` | All tests pass and no-test-change guard runs |
| Story/Epic completion | `pnpm run verify-all` | Full verification, integration, and e2e scaffold pass |

## Manual Verification Checklist

1. Start Convex with `pnpm run convex:dev`.
2. Start app server with `pnpm dev`.
3. Run or simulate a process that finalizes user, model, tool, and process-event entries.
4. Open the process archive surface and verify finalized entries are visible in order.
5. Reload the process and verify archive entries remain visible without environment state.
6. Open the turn view and verify turns reference source archive entries.
7. Open derived views and verify structural turn ranges/chunk candidates have no generated summary text.
8. Simulate missing related source/artifact context and verify only affected entries degrade.
9. Verify archive pagination returns a bounded page with a next cursor.
