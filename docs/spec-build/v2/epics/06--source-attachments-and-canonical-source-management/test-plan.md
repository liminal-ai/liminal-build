# Test Plan: Epic 6 Source Attachments and Canonical Source Management

## Purpose

This test plan maps every Epic 6 test condition to planned tests. It follows
the service-mock strategy: test at Fastify route/service, Convex function, and
client rendering boundaries while mocking only external systems such as GitHub,
environment providers, and configuration.

## Test Strategy

### Test Layers

| Layer | Files | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Convex service tests | `convex/sourceAttachments.test.ts`, `convex/sourceProvenance.test.ts` | Durable schema/function invariants, duplicate checks, soft detach, provenance persistence |
| Fastify service/API tests | `tests/service/server/source-management-api.test.ts`, `tests/service/server/source-management-service.test.ts`, `tests/service/server/process-work-surface-api.test.ts` | Auth/access, routes, request/response contracts, source policy, refresh, degraded states |
| Client service tests | `tests/service/client/source-management-ui.test.ts`, `tests/service/client/source-attachment-section.test.ts`, `tests/service/client/process-materials-section.test.ts`, `tests/service/client/source-provenance-section.test.ts` | User-visible source state, controls, provenance, detach, and degraded states |
| Existing environment tests | `tests/service/server/process-execution-orchestrator.test.ts`, provider adapter tests | Ensure source hydration/checkpoint consumers still work with expanded source contracts |

### Mock Boundaries

| Boundary | Mock? | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| GitHub repository/ref lookup | Yes | Mock `GitHubRepositoryResolver`; no live GitHub calls in service tests |
| Environment provider refresh/hydration | Yes | Mock provider/service outcomes for pending, settled, failed |
| Convex in Fastify route tests | Existing fake/in-memory PlatformStore pattern | Route tests should exercise Fastify services without live Convex |
| Fastify source services in client tests | Mock API layer/fetch only | Do not mock UI components under test |
| Internal source policy helpers | No | Exercise through service or route tests |

## Non-TC Decided Tests

| Test File | Test Description | Reason |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| `tests/service/client/process-live.test.ts` | source schemas accept Epic 6 fields and reject missing required identity/freshness fields | Protects shared contract expansion before route/client work |
| `tests/service/server/source-management-service.test.ts` | derives `repositoryFullName` from valid HTTPS GitHub URLs with and without `.git` | Protects identity normalization used by multiple ACs |
| `tests/service/server/source-management-service.test.ts` | rejects non-GitHub URLs in the first repository-focused slice | Prevents accidental external-source scope creep |
| `tests/service/server/source-management-service.test.ts` | rejects mismatched `repositoryUrl` and provided `repositoryFullName` | Prevents identity spoofing or accidental mismatch |
| `tests/service/server/source-management-service.test.ts` | rejects `read_write` sources that target tags or commits | Locks down writable-ref policy |
| `tests/service/server/source-management-service.test.ts` | resolves missing `targetRef` on `read_write` to the repository default branch before persistence | Clarifies writable-source default-branch behavior |
| `tests/service/server/source-management-service.test.ts` | process-scoped source shadows project-scoped source only for matching process | Critical resolver behavior not covered by one explicit TC |
| `convex/sourceAttachments.test.ts` | detached rows are excluded from active listings but still exist durably | Soft-detach invariant |
| `tests/service/server/source-management-service.test.ts` | branch-head movement marks a hydrated source stale using durable resolved-ref snapshot fields | Covers moving-branch freshness semantics |
| `tests/service/server/source-management-api.test.ts` | request-level refresh errors differ from `refreshStatus: failed` | Clarifies response contract |
| `tests/service/server/source-management-api.test.ts` | unavailable or revoked source reads redact current source details while preserving bounded state | Covers AC-6.2 redaction requirement |
| `tests/service/client/source-management-ui.test.ts` | pending refresh does not render as a fifth hydration state | Protects canonical four-state model |

## Chunk Test Counts

| Chunk | TC Tests | Non-TC Tests | Total | Primary Files |
|-------|----------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| 0 Foundation | 0 | 1 | 1 | contract/schema/fixture tests |
| 1 Attach repositories | 8 | 6 | 14 | source-management API/service, Convex |
| 2 Manage metadata | 5 | 0 | 5 | source-management API, client sections |
| 3 Hydration/freshness | 6 | 3 | 9 | source-management API/UI |
| 4 Provenance | 6 | 2 | 8 | source provenance API, Convex, client |
| 5 Detach | 5 | 1 | 6 | API, Convex, execution orchestrator, UI |
| 6 Reopen/degraded | 5 | 0 | 5 | projects/process work surface API, UI |
| **Total** | **35** | **12** | **47** |  |

The TC count is 35 because Epic 6 has 35 named TCs. Non-TC tests cover identity
normalization, external-source scope exclusion, URL/full-name mismatch,
writable-ref policy, scope-shadowing, branch-drift freshness, soft-detach
invariants, refresh response semantics, unavailable-source redaction, and
canonical hydration-state protection.

## Verification Gates

| Phase | Command | Expected Result |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Skeleton / Red exit | `pnpm run red-verify` | Format, lint, typecheck, and build pass while new behavior tests fail against stubs |
| Development | `pnpm run verify` | Standard project verification passes |
| Green exit | `pnpm run green-verify` | All tests pass and no-test-change guard runs |
| Story/Epic completion | `pnpm run verify-all` | Full verification, integration, and e2e scaffold pass |

## Manual Verification Checklist

1. Start Convex with `pnpm run convex:dev`.
2. Start app server with `pnpm dev`.
3. Open a project shell and attach a GitHub repository at project scope.
4. Open a process work surface and attach a process-scoped repository.
5. Verify duplicate exact attachments are blocked but project/process scope can coexist.
6. Change a target ref and confirm the source becomes stale.
7. Trigger refresh and verify settled or pending state is visible.
8. Detach one source and verify other sources remain visible.
9. Reopen the project and process pages and confirm source/provenance state persists.

## Reconciliation

- TC tests: 35
